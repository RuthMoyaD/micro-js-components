# Micro JS Components

A collection of micro JavaScript components for testing and experimentation. This repository is a playground for building and testing small, reusable UI components.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This repository is still a work in progress. The goal is to explore and test different UI components and patterns. New components will be added over time as they are developed and tested.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each component is organized into its own folder, containing the following:

- **`index.html`**: A simple HTML page to demonstrate the component's functionality.
- **`style.css`**: The component's styles (if any).
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file implementing the component's behavior.

Feel free to explore each folder to understand how each component works and experiment with them as needed.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

To test any component, simply clone the repository, navigate to the desired component folder, and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/micro-js-components.git
cd micro-js-components/button
open index.html
